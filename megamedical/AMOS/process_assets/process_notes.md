This dataset is exceptionally tricky for a few reasons. The biggest block to overcome is why there is not just BRATS2016 and BRATS2021, but that
BRATS2016 has HGG and LGG patients. There are overlap in these patients. Each of these patients has 4 modalities of MRI associated (the same
as MSD because it uses BRATS). Easiest way to do this is to treat these as separate datasets.
